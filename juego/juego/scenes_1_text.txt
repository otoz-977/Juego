the air was filled with thick fog slowly replaced with dark smothering smog from the city
as the flying ship neared the dock, gears shifted rotating the thrusters and slowing the pace, the sound of a bustiling city replaced the wails of the waves
my box was placed in the dock, as two thugs cames and carried me to a wagon. driving slowly through a dark alley.
even thrugh my cage, i was choking on the air  of this disgusting city, with the ground covered in soot and sky chocked in smoke.
